I completed my Master's in Statistics in 2023 and currently work as a data labeling analyst for Meta. **My goal is to transition into machine learning engineering**, a passion sparked while hosting an AI book club in Los Angeles and working in this entry-level role, *adjacent* to machine learning. As I evaluated and refined coding snippets generated by a large language model (LLM), I realized how much more I had to learn. This experience opened my eyes to the vast opportunities in the field, and for the first time in a long while, I felt genuinely excited.

That excitement was significant because I've spent over a decade exploring different career paths—law, journalism, education, non-profits, government work, and even food and beverage—seeking a role that felt both impactful and sustainable for me. The second part of that requirement proved the hardest. Little did I know at the time, I was also navigating ADHD, but we will get to that later. 

One of the best turning points was discovering data journalism while considering a career in journalism. Inspired by the beautiful and impactful data journalism I encountered, I began self-studying technical skills, diving into programming, analysis, and visualization. I rediscovered my love for math, leading me to pursue my MS in Statistics at Texas A&M University.

**Now, I’ve found a career that truly resonates with me. I love the ever-growing field of artificial intelligence and the problem-solving it demands. It’s everything I had hoped for—working on something meaningful and, finally, not being miserable.**

In the early weeks of beginning to pursue machine learning engineering in earnest, I studied key skills in software engineering and concepts in deep learning. I balanced my full-time job with night-after-night studying. My love for machine learning did not waver, but I started feeling constantly stressed and like I was always "behind." 

I eventually realized I was heading straight for burnout. The solution? A plan to create boundaries between work, study, and rest, and to define what "enough" really means. Naturally, I turned to ChatGPT for help. Using a series of prompts, I crafted a customized roadmap to transition from where I am to becoming a machine learning engineer.

I’m sharing this experience to encourage others to do the same. Never before have we had access to this level of mentorship or coaching for free. I’ve chosen to **embrace AI** as a tool to elevate my capabilities, and I hope you will, too.

In this post, I will share the prompts I used to create a comprehensive career plan, along with a simplified version for those looking for a more straightforward approach. Feel free to modify them to suit your personal needs. I’ll also outline the time-blocking routine I developed and provide a list of strategies I use to reduce decision fatigue and minimize friction.



## Comprehensive Career Coaching 


I'm interested in pursuing a career as a machine learning engineer. Please provide a detailed list of the essential skills, knowledge, and experience required for a modern machine learning engineer, taking into account the latest technologies. This will help me understand how much I still need to learn.

-

I have an MS in statistics—should I consider pursuing another advanced degree, or focus on self-study?

-

How can I stay up to date with the latest developments in the field? 

-

There’s always something new to learn, and I want to ensure I allocate the right amount of time to each task. Here are some of the responsibilities I need to balance (though there are more): learning new skills, practicing skills, showcasing skills through projects or published content, learning new concepts, keeping up with research and advancements (e.g., blogs, academic papers, news), networking, and reading books. 

-

Help me create a flexible time-blocking routine to manage my various responsibilities effectively. I want to prioritize these tasks properly. Remember, I need to acquire all the skills you mentioned before for machine learning engineers. 

Limitations: 
- I have a fully remote 9-5 job.
- I can study until 8 PM.
- I read lighter content including AI books from 10-11 PM. 
- I do all my exercise in the morning before work, so I cannot use that time to study. 
- Allocate less time towards large projects because I am still in the process of building foundational skills. 
- I don't want every day to look the same.

*You may have to tweak and refresh this a few times until you get exactly what you want.*

-

I have ADHD, and it's hard to stick to an assigned task. However, I still want to achieve all the same goals by the end of the week. Please share tips to ensure I can maintain my routine.

-

I want to keep track of my knowledge, skills, and abilities. Please provide a comprehensive list of skills required for machine learning engineering, organized into categories. Use keywords only, without descriptions, and ensure the list is as granular as possible. For example, "supervised learning" is not granular enough. 

-

Format this list as a markdown with three columns: subcategory, specification, level (leave empty)

-

I often struggle with projects because I have difficulty deciding what to focus on. While I prefer not to use commonly available datasets, I recognize that they can be beneficial for practicing specific skills. Is there a way to minimize the decision fatigue I experience when starting projects and eliminate the other obstacles that hinder my progress? I want to streamline the process of selecting a project topic and publishing a completed project to GitHub.

## Reducing Decision Fatigue, Friction, and Burnout


- I maintain a prioritized task list for three categories: Deep Learning, Small Projects, and Skills Practice.
- To keep my learning process engaging and varied, I use a dice roller to choose between options. For example, within the Deep Learning category, I roll the dice to decide whether to dive into a course, read an academic paper, or study a textbook during my dedicated time.
- While building my foundational knowledge, I use my Small Projects time to create Python templates and libraries. This practice prepares me for future projects, solidifies my understanding of workflows, and enhances my object-oriented programming skills.
- To stay updated on the latest advancements, I've set up RSS feeds and newsletters in my Omnivore app. When it's time to read, I can dive right into the content. Any important information I highlight is captured in my note-taking app, Obsidian, for future review.
- I generate flashcards on various topics using Code Copilot, formatted for easy import into Anki. Before using the flashcards, I dedicate part of my Skills Practice time to verify the accuracy of each card and add any essential details.
- When I encounter new concepts, I create a new note in Obsidian for each topic (e.g., gradient descent, learning rate decay). Initially, these notes are mostly blank unless I feel the need to add something immediately or outline headers.
- At the end of my Deep Learning sessions, I use a random note selector to revisit and expand on these notes. During this time, I aim to write as much as I can from memory before consulting additional sources, and I try to include Python code where applicable.
- Notes that are ready for publication are uploaded directly to GitHub from Obsidian.
- I do not make any study sessions mandatory. If I have other commitments, I simply continue with my routine without the pressure to "make up" any missed work.

**Just like me, this plan is an ever-developing work in progress.**
