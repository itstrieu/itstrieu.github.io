description: An introduction to Cognitive Curiosities and what you can expect from this blog.
---

Hello! I’m Kathy, and I’m excited to welcome you to **Cognitive Curiosities**. This blog marks the beginning of my journey toward becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)**. My fascination with artificial intelligence drives me to document my experiences, challenges, and triumphs along the way. I hope that by sharing my insights, I can help others on similar paths and inspire engaging conversations.
<br>
<br>
# What Can You Expect Here?
<br>
### 1. Machine Learning Techniques and Tools

My passion for machine learning compels me to delve deep into its intricacies. To solidify my understanding, I often employ the *Feynman Method,* which allows me to simplify complex concepts. By sharing what I learn, I not only reinforce my knowledge but also hone my professional writing and editing skills. Expect posts that include:

- Explorations of various algorithms and techniques
- Hands-on tutorials and project write-ups

<br>
<br>

### 2. My Career Journey

Transparency is vital to me as I navigate my transition to a machine learning engineer role. This path is undoubtedly challenging, but I am eager to share my experiences with you. Look forward to posts covering:

- Steps I’m taking to build my skills and portfolio
- Reflections on both my successes and challenges

<br>
<br>

### 3. Neurodiversity in Tech

As someone who identifies as neurodivergent, my late ADHD diagnosis has profoundly influenced my learning and working style in technology. This newfound awareness has allowed me to better understand my mind and discover effective strategies for managing it. While I may only occasionally dedicate full posts to my ADHD experiences, I will weave this perspective throughout my writing, covering topics such as:

- How neurodiversity shapes my problem-solving approach
- Strategies for maintaining focus and productivity in a fast-paced tech environment
- Celebrating the strengths arising from diverse cognitive styles

<br>
<br>

### 4. Ethical Considerations in AI

My background in human rights and democracy advocacy informs my approach to technology. I am committed to using AI to enhance society for all. Currently, I host a book club in LA where we explore different AI books each month, fostering meaningful discussions about their implications.

Machine learning and AI extend beyond technology; they raise critical ethical questions. As I navigate this landscape, I will discuss:

- The societal impacts of AI
- The responsibilities of machine learning engineers in ensuring fairness and transparency
- Philosophical considerations surrounding the technology we develop

I am genuinely excited to witness groundbreaking advancements in AI and eager to share my reflections with you.

### 5. Curated Resources

I understand how overwhelming it can be to sift through the multitude of available resources, especially for those building self-discipline and optimizing productivity on their own. I’ll curate materials tailored for individuals like myself—those dedicated to deep understanding, possibly navigating ADHD, and pursuing their goals without a formal degree program. Expect:

- Reviews of books that have significantly shaped my understanding of machine learning
- Recommendations for online courses and learning platforms designed for self-directed learners

## Why I Started This Blog

Reading _A Brief History of Intelligence_ revealed the interconnectedness of my diverse interests, including mental health, productivity, pedagogy, machine learning, technology, neurodivergence, mindfulness, consciousness, and humanity. These themes converge around the concept of intelligence, which I find endlessly fascinating—especially regarding the brain and consciousness.

My passion for learning and sharing insights motivates this blog. Documenting my journey not only fosters my reflection and growth but also connects me with others who share similar interests. As I pursue this career path without a formal research degree, I aim to create tangible evidence of my efforts. I’ve always valued community-building, finding joy in bringing people together around both shared and contrasting interests. Establishing a blog that nurtures such a community resonates deeply with me, allowing me to connect with others who share my passions.

Whether you are a fellow learner, an experienced professional, or simply curious about artificial intelligence, I hope you find valuable insights here. Together, let’s navigate this fascinating landscape, celebrate our diverse perspectives, and cultivate a supportive community.

Thank you for visiting **Cognitive Curiosities**! I’m excited to share my journey with you and look forward to where this adventure takes us.
